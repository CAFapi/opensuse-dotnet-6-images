# opensuse-dotnet-6-images

This project builds three openSUSE-based images which include the .NET6 Runtime Environment, the .ASPNETCORE6 
Runtime Environment or the .NET6 Software Development Kit and are based off the 
[OpenSUSE java 8 images](https://github.com/CAFapi/opensuse-java8-images). 

These can be used as a base image by projects which require the associated .NET6 environment.
